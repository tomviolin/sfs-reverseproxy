## SFS reverse proxy

This webserver microservice is intended to run on waterbase.uwm.edu and serve as the friendly URL frontend for all SFS web services.

For example, instead of having to type

    [www.sfs-fatm.sfs.uwm.edu:8883/intake](http://sfs-fatm.sfs.uwm.edu:8883/intake)
    
SFS users will be able to use

   [www.sfs.uwm.edu/intake](http://www.sfs.uwm.edu/intake)
